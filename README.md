MVC Tutorial extended with Bootstrap

Project
=========================
Jesse Boyer created a nice tutorial about a simple MVC system

I'll be extending it with bootstrap, move some paths around and update it a little

Router
-------------------------

I also need a router, so I'll be using his other project for that

Config
-------------------------
Make sure you copy app/config/config.dist.php to config.php
Make sure you have created the database and imported the sql_dump
